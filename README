Testing should work as bootstrap, just run:

#  bin/metap2p

If you get a message telling you about dependancy problems, follow the instructions on the screen.

Edit your conf/peers.list with the peers you wish to test against.

Dependencies:
  twisted, yaml, routes and ipaddr

  ipaddr will be removed in the future since it does not serve it's purpose properly

Thanks to:
  Twisted, for having such an awesome framework.
  Nevow project, for inspiring me about minitemplating (based on STAN, but not complete).
